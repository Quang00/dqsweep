"""
Nonlocal CNOT Quantum Experiment
--------------------------------

This module implements a nonlocal CNOT experiment between two parties:
Alice and Bob. The experiment utilizes quantum entanglement and classical
communication to perform a distributed CNOT gate.

The process consists of:
  - Alice generating EPR pairs, applying a CNOT gate, and measuring qubits.
  - Bob receiving the EPR pairs, applying corrections based on Aliceâ€™s
    measurements, and computing fidelity.
  - Classical communication between Alice and Bob to share measurement
    results and ensure proper corrections.

The results include fidelity computation and simulation time tracking
for performance evaluation.
